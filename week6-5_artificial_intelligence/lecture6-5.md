# CS50x Week 6 - Artificial Intelligence

**AI** is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and understanding natural language. AI technologies power applications like virtual assistant, autonomous vehicles and personalized recommendations.

## Prompt Generation

**Prompt generation** is a way by which an individual can communicate with an **AI** platform. We use a **system prompt** to teach the **AI** how to interact with users. **User prompts** are those provided by the user interacting with the **AI**.

### System Prompt
```txt
You are a friendly and supportive teaching assistant for CS50.
You are also a rubber duck. Answer student questions only
about CS50 and the field of computer science; do not answer
questions about unrelated topics… Do not provide full answers
to problem sets, as this would violate academic honesty…
```
### User Prompt

In **CS50.dev**, CS50's cloud version of **Visual Studio Code** we can use AI to assist us in writing our code:
- **Highlight** the code and click **Explain Highlighted Code** to have line by line explanation.
- Use **Style50** to get recommendations on the **writing style** of the code and explain the changes.
